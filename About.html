<p>I am a graduate student here in Applied Computer Science from India. By profession, I am an SAP MM Consultant. I worked for Accenture, back in India for a couple of years after undergraduation. My client at Accenture is an American multinational food manufacturing company. The moment I began to understand SAP and its business processes, I was so involved into it that I ended up as the topper of my training batch. I am actively involved in different roles such as implementing enhancement requests, resolving the incidents faced by the end users in their day to day activities.</p>
<p>I have heard a lot from the previous students regarding the challenging course work here. My areas of intrests include Project Management and IT Management as well. And that is the main reason why I am here at Northwest. I was extremely delighted to be the part of Bearcat Family.</p>
<p>After graduating from Northwest I would like to see myself working for a multinationl company, managing a team and obviously my dream place to work for would be SAP.</p>
